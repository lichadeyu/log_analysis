Log File Analyzer
Log File Analyzer is a Streamlit-based web application designed to process log files, analyze access patterns, detect suspicious activities (e.g., failed login attempts), and generate detailed CSV reports.

You can explore the live application here: ðŸ‘‰ Log File Analyzer.

Features
ðŸ›  Core Functionalities
Log Parsing: Extract critical details such as:
Client IP Address
Timestamp
HTTP Method (e.g., GET, POST)
Endpoint (e.g., /login, /home)
HTTP Status Code (e.g., 200, 401, 404)
Response Size
Custom messages from the logs
Interactive Analysis:
Requests categorized by IP address
Identification of the most accessed endpoints
Flagging of suspicious activities like repeated failed login attempts
Exportable Reports: Generate and download CSV reports summarizing the analysis results.
âš¡ Performance
Efficiently handles large log files with thousands of entries.
Provides near-instant feedback with processing time statistics.
ðŸ–¥ User-Friendly Interface
Intuitive web interface for quick log file analysis.
Interactive tables and metrics for better insights.
Fully responsive design accessible on desktop and mobile browsers.
ðŸ”’ Customizable Thresholds
Users can set a suspicious activity threshold to detect unusual behavior, such as brute-force login attempts.
Deployment
The Log File Analyzer is deployed and hosted on Streamlit Cloud. You can access the live version here:

How to Use
Step 1: Upload Your Log File
Drag and drop or browse to upload your .log file directly in the app.
Step 2: Define Suspicious Threshold
Use the input field to specify the number of failed login attempts that classify an IP as suspicious.
Step 3: Analyze Results
View metrics such as:
Processing Time: Time taken to analyze the log file.
Rows Processed: Total number of log entries analyzed.
Most Accessed Endpoint: The endpoint with the highest traffic and its access count.
Suspicious IPs: IP addresses flagged for unusual behavior.
Step 4: Export Results
Download the analysis as a CSV file for offline use or reporting.
Example Use Cases
Server Security Monitoring:

Detect suspicious IP addresses performing failed logins repeatedly.
Identify brute-force attacks or unauthorized access attempts.
Traffic Analysis:

Understand traffic patterns by endpoint and client IP.
Optimize website performance by identifying high-traffic endpoints.
Debugging and Log Investigation:

Investigate errors or failed requests (e.g., HTTP 500, 404).
Compliance and Reporting:

Generate reports for compliance or internal documentation.

Processing Time: Shows how long it took to process the log file.
Most Accessed Endpoint: Highlights the endpoint receiving the most requests.
Suspicious IPs: Lists IPs with failed login attempts exceeding the defined threshold.
Tables:
Requests Per IP Address: A detailed breakdown of requests grouped by IP address.
Suspicious Activity: A table displaying IPs flagged for suspicious behavior.
